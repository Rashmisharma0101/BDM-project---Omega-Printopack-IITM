**Title:**
  Minimize Defect Rate in Manufacturing Packaging Products
  
  **Objective:**
  To analyze defect patterns in printed packaging cartons using production data and identify key factors contributing to defects. 
  This helps in targeting specific areas (machines, operators, design complexity, etc.) for quality improvement.
  
  **Tools Used:**
  Power BI, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Python
  
  **Key Metrics and Insights:**
  Total Production: 1466 cartons
  
  Total Defective Cartons: 220 (~15.0%)
  
  **High-Impact Factors:**
  
    **Water Usage Change:** 66% of defects occurred after water was changed during printing.
    
    **Operator Impact:** Raghav, Amit, and Dinesh recorded 81, 72, and 67 defects respectively.
    
    **Machine Impact:** Komori - M03 accounted for the highest defects (89), followed by M01 (69).
    
    **Fold Complexity:** Defects increased with number of folds – 60 defects at 12 folds.
    
    **Design Complexity:** High-complexity designs had more defects, especially in January and March.
    
    **Monthly Trend:** January 2025 had the highest number of defects (45); February had the lowest (31).
    
    **Time Period:**
    November 2024 – April 2025
  
  **Visualizations Included:**
    **KPI cards:** Total defects, water-related defect %, Operator Experience, Fold Complexity
    
    **Bar charts:** Operator performance, machine performance, fold complexity
    
    **Line chart:** Monthly defect trends
    
    **Clustered bar chart:** Design complexity impact
    
    **Slicers:** Defect type and shift
  
  **Outcome:**
  This dashboard allows quality and operations teams to monitor defects across operators, machines, time, and complexity — 
  and provides insights to implement corrective actions like operator training, process control after water change, and machine calibration.
