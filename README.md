**Power BI Dashboard - BDM project - Omega Printopack/IITM**
 
  **Title:**
  Minimize Defect Rate in Manufacturing Packaging Products
  
  **Objective:**
  To analyze defect patterns in printed packaging cartons using production data and identify key factors contributing to defects. 
  This helps in targeting specific areas (machines, operators, design complexity, etc.) for quality improvement.
  
  **Tools Used:**
  Power BI, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Python
  
  **Key Metrics and Insights:**
  
   - Total Production: 1466 cartons
   - Total Defective Cartons: 220 (~15.0%)
   - Machine - Komori-M02 is the most efficient out of three machines
   - Most Common defect type is crushed cartons
   - Defects are highest in the morning shift, influenced more by environmental conditions than operator experience.
   - As number of folds of carton increases., the defects also increase as there are higher chances of mishandling, and misalignment
   - Print Design complexity also leads to higher defects specially related to misprints
   - Temperature, Humidity fall under environmental factors that play crucial role in determining quality of cartons manufactured. Extreme   temperatures show unfavorable outcomes on carton production
   - Humidity was almost controlled at all times during production processes and has not much affected carton quality
   - IPA - Iso propyl alcohol also affects printing processes. Few defect rate spike are seen in the range of 11% to 12%
   - Operators who have more experience have less defective cartons and vice versa, They need more training and skill enhancement
   - pH control is well-maintained within the process and does not significantly contribute to the defect rate
  
  **High-Impact Factors:**
  
   - Water Usage Change: 66% of defects occurred after water was changed during printing.
    
   - Operator Impact: Raghav, Amit, and Dinesh recorded 81, 72, and 67 defects respectively.
    
   - Machine Impact: Komori - M03 accounted for the highest defects (89), followed by M01 (69).
    
   - Fold Complexity: Defects increased with number of folds – 60 defects at 12 folds.
    
   - Design Complexity: High-complexity designs had more defects, especially in January and March.
    
   - Monthly Trend: January 2025 had the highest number of defects (45); February had the lowest (31).
    
   - Time Period: November 2024 – April 2025
  
  **Visualizations Included:**
   - KPI cards: Total defects, water-related defect %, Operator Experience, Fold Complexity
    
   - Bar charts: Operator performance, machine performance, fold complexity
    
   - Line chart: Monthly defect trends
    
   - Clustered bar chart: Design complexity impact
    
   - Slicers: Defect type and shift
  
  **Outcome:**
  This dashboard allows quality and operations teams to monitor defects across operators, machines, time, and complexity — 
  and provides insights to implement corrective actions like operator training, process control after water change, and machine calibration.
